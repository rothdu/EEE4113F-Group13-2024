ABSTRACT = {With the increase of smart farming in the agricultural sector, farmers have better control over the entire production cycle, notably in terms of pest monitoring. In fact, pest monitoring has gained significant importance, since the excessive use of pesticides can lead to great damage to crops, substantial environmental impact, and unnecessary costs both in material and manpower. Despite the potential of new technologies, pest monitoring is still done in a traditional way, leading to excessive costs, lack of precision, and excessive use of human labour. In this paper, we present an Internet of Things (IoT) network combined with intelligent Computer Vision (CV) techniques to improve pest monitoring. First, we propose to use low-cost cameras at the edge that capture images of pest traps and send them to the cloud. Second, we use deep neural models, notably R-CNN and YOLO models, to detect the Whitefly (WF) pest in yellow sticky traps. Finally, the predicted number of WF is analysed over time and results are accessible to farmers through a mobile app that allows them to visualise the pest in each specific field. The contribution is to make pest monitoring autonomous, cheaper, data-driven, and precise. Results demonstrate that, by combining IoT, CV technology, and deep models, it is possible to enhance pest monitoring.},

ABSTRACT = {The codling moth (Cydia pomonella) is probably the most harmful pest in apple and pear orchards. The crop loss due to the high harmfulness of the insect can be extremely expensive; therefore, sophisticated pest management is necessary to protect the crop. The conventional monitoring approach for insect swarming has been based on traps that are periodically checked by human operators. However, this workflow can be automatized. To achieve this goal, a dedicated image capture device and an accurate insect counter algorithm are necessary which make online insect swarm prediction possible. From the hardware side, more camera-equipped embedded systems have been designed to remotely capture and upload pest trap images. From the software side, with the aid of machine vision and machine learning methods, traditional (manual) identification and counting can be solved by algorithm. With the appropriate combination of the hardware and software components, spraying can be accurately scheduled, and the crop-defending cost will be significantly reduced. Although automatic traps have been developed for more pest species and there are a large number of papers which investigate insect detection, a limited number of articles focus on the C. pomonella. The aim of this paper is to review the state of the art of C. pomonella monitoring with camera-equipped traps. The paper presents the advantages and disadvantages of automated trapsâ€™ hardware and software components and examines their practical applicability.},

abstract = {Abstract The field of biology has seen tremendous technological progress in recent years, fuelled by the exponential growth in processing power and high-level computing, and the rise of global information sharing. Low-cost single-board computers are predicted to be one of the key technological advancements to further revolutionise this field. So far, an overview of current uptake of these devices and a general guide to help researchers integrate them in their work has been missing. In this paper I focus on the most widely used single-board computer, the Raspberry Pi, and review its broad applications and uses across the biological domain. Since its release in 2012, the Raspberry Pi has been increasingly taken up by biologists, in the laboratory, the field and in the classroom, and across a wide range of disciplines. A hugely diverse range of applications exists that ranges from simple solutions to dedicated custom-build devices, including nest-box monitoring, wildlife camera trapping, high-throughput behavioural recording, large-scale plant phenotyping, underwater video surveillance, closed-loop operant learning experiments and autonomous ecosystem monitoring. Despite the breadth of its implementations, the depth of uptake of the Raspberry Pi by the scientific community is still limited. The broad capabilities of the Raspberry Pi, combined with its low cost, ease of use and large user community make it a great research tool for almost any project. To help accelerate the uptake of the Raspberry Pi by the scientific community, I provide detailed guidelines, recommendations and considerations, and 30+ step-by-step guides on a dedicated accompanying website (http://raspberrypi-guide.github.io). I hope this paper will help generate more awareness about the Raspberry Pi among scientists and thereby both fuel the democratisation of science and ultimately help advance our understanding of biology, from the micro- to the macro-scale.},

abstract = {Abstract The utility, availability, cost-effectiveness, and reliability of prefabricated video systems designed to monitor wildlife have lagged behind the unique and varied needs of many researchers. Many systems are limited by inflexible video settings, lack of adequate data storage, and cannot be programmed by the user. More sophisticated systems can be cost prohibitive, and the literature describing remote wildlife video monitoring has, for the most part, not incorporated advances in camera and computer technology. Here, we present details of a pilot study to design and construct a lower cost (US \$340) nest camera system to record the behavior of Acorn Woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) in artificial tree cavity nests. This system incorporates a Raspberry Pi micro-computer, Pi NoIR infrared camera, a wireless adapter to transmit video over the Internet, and Deka rechargeable gel batteries for power. We programmed the system to motion-sense, to record exclusively during daylight hours, and to automatically upload videos to the cloud over wireless Internet. The Raspberry Pi micro-computer does not require advanced programming or electrical engineering skills to build and configure and, because it is programmable, provides unprecedented flexibility for field researchers who wish to configure the system to the specific needs of their study.},
