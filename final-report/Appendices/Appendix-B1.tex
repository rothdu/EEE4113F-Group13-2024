    GA3 & Engineering Design & Chapter \ref{ch:firmware} details the development of firmware for the starling next-camera project. After engagement with project stakeholders, the requirements and specifications of the subsystem were anaylsed. A number of high-level design decisions were considered and detailed, followed by extensive testing of the subsystem on the project hardware. Finally, a number of acceptance test procedures were developed and performed. The source code for the firmware is available in the \href{https://github.com/rothdu/EEE4113F-Group13-2024}{project repository} on GitHub. \\ \hline

    GA7 & Sustainability and Impact of Engineering Activity & The starling nest-camera project works towards sustainability of engineering activity by developing a tool for research in wildlife conservation. \\ \hline

    GA8 & Individual, Team and Multidiscipliniary Working & The overall project encompassed extensive teamwork, including a collective analysis of the needs of the project stakeholders and a joint literature review. Much of this communication is viewable on the group's Microsoft Teams chat. Within the framework of the group project, individual work was done in the development of the firmware subsystem. The group members encompassed a multidiscipliniary engineering team, with specialisations in Electrical Engineer, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechatronics. The project also involved extensive engagement with ornothological researchers, who outside of the engineering field. \\ \hline

    GA10 & Engineering Professionalism & Throughout the project, professional relationships and communication were maintained with the other group members, project stakeholders and project staff. All deliverables were presented on time. \\ \hline

    GA3 & Engineering Design & Chapter \ref{ch:hardware} details the development of the hardware for the Red-Winged Starling Nest Monitoring project. After engagement with project stakeholders, the user requirements, functional requirements and specifications were created and analysed. Thereafter, the entire design process was documented. This was followed by a thorough round of testing of the microcontroller functionality and support circuitry. Finally, a number of acceptance test procedures were developed and performed. The source code for the firmware is available in the \href{https://github.com/rothdu/EEE4113F-Group13-2024}{project repository} on GitHub. \\ \hline

    GA8 & Individual, Team and Multidiscipliniary Working & Throughout the project, teamwork was key in making sure the final product worked together harmoniously. This involved creating a joint literature review, along with communicating weekly on Microsoft Teams. Extensive discussions were conducted, with the main objective to find the perfect solution to meet the stakeholder requirements, as well as dividing the work into equal subsystems. Thereafter, individual work was conducted to develop the hardware subsystem of the camera/transmitter and receiver on my end. The group members encompassed a multidiscipliniary engineering team, with specialisations in Electrical Engineer, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mechatronics. The project also involved extensive engagement with ornothological researchers, who outside of the engineering field. \\ \hline
