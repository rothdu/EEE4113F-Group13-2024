"Video footage ideal, otherwise 3 photos in quick succession", "These requirements are fairly loose - the essence is that the user wants as much data as possible. Find an appropriate balance between storage constraints and amount of data captured, using the user specifications as a baseline. Allow soft-configurable capturing modes so that the user can fine-tune the amount of data they gather."
"Suggested interval of one minute between triggers"
"Access to the images in real time (daily)", "With automatic data uploads, data must be transferred at least daily"
"Triggered with movement", "Take input from the PIR sensors to trigger camera activity"
"Access data without disturbing the nests, possibly with wireless data access", "Utilise the wireless connectivity on the camera/transmitter module to transfer data to the receiver or the web"
"Keep track of noise levels around the nest"

"Track over the breeding season (7 weeks) without need to change batteries too often", "Utilise power-saving mechanisms wherever possible."
